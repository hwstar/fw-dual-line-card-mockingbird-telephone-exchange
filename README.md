The Mockingbird telephone exchange is a suite of hardware and firmware projects to emulate the way American analog telephone switches sounded and worked in the 20th century.

Features: 
* Written with platformio and the Arduino framework.
* STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller.
* Handles I2C communication with the main microcontroller
* State machines for originating and terminating calls.
* Designed to run on the associated dual line card design (See hackaday.io link below).
